Build:
  - Replace Bower (deprecated) with Yarn or WebPack (probably WebPack)

  npm WARN deprecated bower@1.8.0: ..psst! While Bower is maintained, we recommend Yarn and Webpack
  for *new* front-end projects! Yarn's advantage is security and reliability, and Webpack's is
  support for both CommonJS and AMD projects. Currently there's no migration path, but please
  help to create it: https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/2467
  /usr/local/bin/bower -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/bower/bin/bower
